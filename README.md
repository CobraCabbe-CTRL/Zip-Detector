# Zip-Detector
This Python script checks if a given path is a link or a file download. The user is prompted to enter the path they want to check. The script then converts the path into Unicode characters and checks for specific character combinations to determine if the path is a link or a file download. If the path is determined to be a link, the user is asked if they want to open it in a new tab. If the user responds with ‘Y’, the link is opened in a new tab using the webbrowser module.
